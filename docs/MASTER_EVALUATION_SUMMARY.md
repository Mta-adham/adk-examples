2. **Performance**: Implement caching for RAG operations
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerting for evaluation timeouts and failures
4. **Scaling**: Consider regional deployment for better performance

## Python Compatibility Analysis

### Root Cause: numpy Dependency Chain
**Primary Issue**: numpy 2.3.2 distribution incompatibility with Python 3.12/3.13
- numpy 2.3.2 wheels only available for Python 3.11
- Current environment varies between Python 3.12-3.13 across agents
- Affects 4 out of 11 agents (36% of collection)

### Affected Agents and Resolutions
1. **Marketing Agency**: ❌ Blocked - Requires Python 3.11 environment
2. **Personalized Shopping**: ❌ Complex ML Dependencies - Requires Python 3.11 + ML infrastructure  
3. **Travel Concierge**: ❌ Blocked - Requires Python 3.11 environment
4. **RAG Agent**: ✅ Has successful evaluation results, Python 3.11 needed for new setup

## Future Work

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Python 3.11 Environment**: Set up dedicated Python 3.11 environment for blocked agents
2. **ML Infrastructure**: Provision proper resources for Personalized Shopping (PyTorch, 5.1GB dataset)
3. **Dependency Management**: Consider conda for better ML dependency handling
4. **Container Strategy**: Docker environments with pre-configured Python versions

### Evaluation Framework Improvements
1. **Environment Testing**: Pre-flight dependency compatibility checks
2. **Python Version Management**: Automated environment switching per agent
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Adjust timeouts based on agent complexity
4. **Response Consistency**: Develop better evaluation metrics for LLM variability
