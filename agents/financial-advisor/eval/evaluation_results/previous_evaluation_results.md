# Financial Advisor Agent - Previous Evaluation Results

## Overview
This file documents the previous evaluation results as reported in the EVALUATION.md guide and EVALUATION_RESULTS.md file.

## Previous Test Results Summary

### Status: ⚠️ FAILED (Similarity threshold not met)

The previous evaluations consistently failed to meet the required similarity thresholds despite demonstrating functional correctness.

## Documented Results from EVALUATION.md

### Test Configuration
- **Test cases**: Located in `eval/data/financial-advisor.test.json`
- **Number of runs**: 5 iterations per test case
- **Success criteria**:
  - `response_match_score`: 0.8 (80% similarity threshold)
  - `tool_trajectory_avg_score`: 1.0 (100% tool usage accuracy)

### Performance Results
- **Response Match Scores**: 0.58-0.65 (consistently below 0.8 threshold)
- **Tool Trajectory**: Perfect performance (met 1.0 threshold)
- **Overall Status**: FAILED due to response similarity issues

### Common Failure Patterns
1. **Response Structure**: Agent responses included additional explanatory text not present in expected responses
2. **Phrasing Variations**: Functionally equivalent but differently worded responses
3. **Disclaimer Placement**: Legal disclaimers appeared in different positions or with slightly different wording

### Example Comparison
**Expected**: "Great! To begin, please provide the market ticker symbol you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)."

**Actual**: "Great! Let's start with the first step: Gathering Market Data Analysis. I'll be using our `data_analyst` subagent for this. Please provide the market ticker symbol you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)."

**Score**: 0.58/0.8 (FAILED)

## Detailed Results from EVALUATION_RESULTS.md

### Comprehensive Evaluation Summary

| Run | Duration | Tool Trajectory Score | Response Match Score | Overall Status |
|-----|----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1   | 53.80s   | ✅ 1.0 (PASSED)      | ❌ 0.774 (FAILED)   | **FAILED**     |
| 2   | 55.15s   | ✅ 1.0 (PASSED)      | ❌ 0.788 (FAILED)   | **FAILED**     |

### Key Findings from Previous Evaluations

#### ✅ Functional Assessment
Despite evaluation failures, the agent demonstrated:
- Correct workflow execution
- Proper sub-agent orchestration
- Appropriate response to user inputs
- Complete legal disclaimer inclusion
- Structured financial advisory process
- Professional greeting and introduction
- Explanation of 4-step financial advisory process
- Mention of specialized sub-agents
- Proper disclaimers and educational tone

#### ❌ Technical Issues
1. **Consistency Issues**: Response scores varied between runs (0.774 vs 0.788)
2. **Near-Threshold Performance**: Average score of 0.781 (97.6% of required threshold)
3. **Text Variations**: Minor phrasing differences causing evaluation failures

### Environment Setup (Previous)
- **Python Version**: 3.9.21 via Poetry virtual environment
- **Dependencies**: 129 packages including `google-adk v1.8.0`
- **Configuration**: Mixed PEP 621 and Poetry formats (later fixed)

### Test Dataset Configuration
- **File**: `eval/data/financial-advisor.test.json`
- **Test Cases**: 1 case (`intro_only`)
- **Conversation Turns**: 2 turns per case
- **Runs**: 5 iterations per evaluation

## Previous Recommendations

### 1. Adjust Evaluation Threshold
- Consider lowering `response_match_score` threshold from 0.8 to 0.75
- Current performance was functionally correct
- Text similarity metrics sensitive to minor phrasing variations

### 2. Investigate Response Variability
- Add deterministic seeding to reduce run-to-run variance
- Analyze which parts of responses cause similarity score variations
- Consider multiple similarity metrics for robust evaluation

### 3. Enhanced Testing
- Add more test cases beyond single `intro_only` scenario
- Test complete financial advisory workflow
- Include edge cases and error handling scenarios

## Technical Configuration (Previous)

### Default Evaluation Criteria
```python
DEFAULT_CRITERIA = {
    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0,  # 1-point scale; 1.0 is perfect
    "response_match_score": 0.8,      # Rouge-1 text match; 0.8 is default
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=evoml-mcp
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

## Conclusion

Previous evaluations showed the Financial Advisor agent was **functionally ready for use** but failed strict evaluation criteria due to minor text variations. The agent correctly implemented the intended financial advisory workflow with appropriate safety disclaimers, suggesting evaluation thresholds may have been too strict for the response generation approach used at the time.
