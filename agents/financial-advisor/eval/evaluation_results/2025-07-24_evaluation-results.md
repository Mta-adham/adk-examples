# Financial Advisor Agent - Evaluation Results
**Date**: 2025-07-24

## Evaluation Results

**Status**: ⚠️ FAILED (Similarity threshold not met)

The evaluation successfully executed but failed to meet the required similarity thresholds. Here are the key findings:

### Response Match Scores
Most test cases scored between **0.58-0.65** against the required **0.8** threshold. The agent responses were functionally correct but differed in phrasing and structure from expected responses.

### Common Failure Patterns
1. **Response Structure**: Agent responses included additional explanatory text not present in expected responses
2. **Phrasing Variations**: Functionally equivalent but differently worded responses
3. **Disclaimer Placement**: Legal disclaimers appeared in different positions or with slightly different wording

### Example Comparison
**Expected**: "Great! To begin, please provide the market ticker symbol you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)."

**Actual**: "Great! Let's start with the first step: Gathering Market Data Analysis. I'll be using our `data_analyst` subagent for this. Please provide the market ticker symbol you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)."

**Score**: 0.58/0.8

## Functional Assessment

Despite evaluation failures, the agent demonstrates:
- ✅ Correct workflow execution
- ✅ Proper sub-agent orchestration
- ✅ Appropriate response to user inputs
- ✅ Complete legal disclaimer inclusion
- ✅ Structured financial advisory process

## Evaluation Interpretation

The current evaluation results indicate that while the agent is functionally correct, the evaluation framework is sensitive to:
- Response formatting differences
- Additional explanatory content
- Minor phrasing variations

For production use, consider:
1. Adjusting similarity thresholds to account for natural language variation
2. Focusing on functional correctness rather than exact text matching
3. Updating expected responses to reflect current agent behavior patterns
