# Travel Concierge Agent - Evaluation Results
**Date**: 2025-07-24

## Evaluation Results

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY FAILED (2/3 tests passed)

**Execution Time**: ~216 seconds (3 minutes 37 seconds)

### Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `test_inspire` | ✅ PASSED | Travel inspiration functionality working correctly |
| `test_pretrip` | ✅ PASSED | Pre-trip agent transfer and basic functionality working |
| `test_intrip` | ❌ FAILED | KeyError: 'start_date' in itinerary inspection |

### Detailed Test Analysis

**✅ Inspire Test (PASSED)**
- Successfully handles travel inspiration requests
- Agent correctly transfers to inspiration sub-agent
- Provides relevant destination suggestions for requested regions

**✅ Pre-trip Test (PASSED)**  
- Successfully transfers to pre-trip agent
- Agent correctly identifies trip details from state
- Proper recognition of travel dates and nationality information

**❌ In-trip Test (FAILED)**
- **Error**: `KeyError: 'start_date'` in `_inspect_itinerary()` function
- **Location**: `travel_concierge/sub_agents/in_trip/tools.py:197`
- **Root Cause**: The `_inspect_itinerary()` function expects `itinerary["start_date"]` to exist, but test data contains empty itinerary (`{}`)
- **Impact**: In-trip monitoring and transit coordination functionality cannot execute

### Error Details

```python
# Problem code in tools.py:197
current_datetime = itinerary["start_date"] + " 00:00"
```

The function assumes the itinerary dictionary contains a `start_date` key, but the test scenario provides an empty itinerary object, causing a KeyError when accessing `itinerary["start_date"]`.

## Assessment

Two of three test scenarios pass completely, demonstrating working inspiration and pre-trip capabilities. The in-trip test failure reveals a robustness issue that should be addressed before production deployment, with the primary issue being insufficient error handling for edge cases in state management.
