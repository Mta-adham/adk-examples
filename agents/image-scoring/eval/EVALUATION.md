# Image Scoring Agent Evaluation Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the evaluation tests for the Image Scoring Agent.

## Overview

The Image Scoring Agent is an AI-powered system built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that generates images from text descriptions, evaluates them against predefined policies, and iteratively improves them until they meet quality standards. The agent uses a multi-step workflow with specialized sub-agents for prompt generation, image creation, scoring, and quality checking.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- uv (for dependency management)
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI and Imagen API enabled
- Google Cloud SDK
- Google Cloud Storage bucket for image storage

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the environment template and configure your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your project configuration:

```env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-storage-bucket
SCORE_THRESHOLD=10
MAX_ITERATIONS=3
IMAGEN_MODEL="imagen-3.0-generate-002"
GENAI_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"
```

### 3. Authenticate and Setup GCS

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gsutil mb gs://your-storage-bucket  # If bucket doesn't exist
```

## Running the Evaluation

Execute the evaluation tests using pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest eval -v
```

## Evaluation Test Cases

The evaluation consists of one comprehensive test scenario:

### Image Generation and Scoring Test (`test.json`)
Tests the complete image generation and evaluation workflow:
- **Input**: "A shepherd along with sheeps on a grassland"
- **Expected Tools**: Tests proper tool usage sequence including policy retrieval, image generation, scoring, and condition checking
- **Workflow Verification**: Ensures the agent follows the correct sequence of sub-agent interactions

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation uses two key metrics:

1. **Tool Trajectory Average Score**: Measures correctness of tool usage sequence (expected threshold: 1.0)
2. **Response Match Score**: Measures response quality and completeness (expected threshold: 0.2)

## Test Results

The agent can be evaluated using pytest as described above. See the evaluation configuration for details on test scenarios and success criteria.

## Success Criteria

The evaluation test demonstrates that the agent:

1. **Tool Integration**: Correctly executes the expected sequence of tools in proper order
2. **API Integration**: Successfully connects to Google Cloud Vertex AI, Imagen, and Storage APIs  
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Properly coordinates between sub-agents (prompt, image, scoring, checker)
4. **Policy Compliance**: Implements policy-based image evaluation system
5. **Storage Management**: Correctly handles image storage and retrieval from GCS
6. **Migration Compatibility**: Functions correctly after migration from Poetry to uv

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication Errors**
   - Verify Google Cloud credentials: `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Ensure required APIs are enabled: Vertex AI, Imagen, Cloud Storage
   - Check project permissions for the service account

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Install all extras: `uv sync --all-extras`
   - Check Python version compatibility (requires 3.11+)

3. **Storage Bucket Issues**
   - Ensure bucket exists: `gsutil ls gs://your-bucket-name`
   - Verify bucket permissions for image storage
   - Check bucket location matches project location

4. **Evaluation Failures**
   - Verify test data files exist in `eval/data/`
   - Check environment variables in `.env` file
   - Ensure sufficient API quotas for Imagen and Vertex AI

### uv-Specific Setup

After migration to uv, ensure:
- Use `uv sync` instead of `poetry install`
- Use `uv run` instead of `poetry run`
- Dependencies are properly specified in `pyproject.toml` [project] section

## Evaluation Output Schema

### Standard Metrics

The evaluation uses two key metrics to assess multi-agent image generation workflow:

#### Tool Trajectory Average Score
- **Type**: Float (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Description**: Measures correctness of tool usage sequence across all sub-agents in the image workflow
- **Interpretation**:
  - 1.0 = Perfect sequence: policy retrieval → image generation → image retrieval → scoring → condition checking
  - < 1.0 = Missing tools, incorrect sequence, or sub-agent coordination failures
- **Threshold**: 1.0 (expected threshold from test configuration)

#### Response Match Score
- **Type**: Float (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Description**: Measures response quality and completeness using ROUGE scoring
- **Interpretation**:
  - Higher values indicate better completion of image generation and evaluation workflow
  - Accounts for policy compliance reporting and quality assessment explanations
- **Threshold**: 0.2 (expected threshold from test configuration)

### Multi-Agent Workflow Evaluation

The evaluation specifically tests coordination between specialized sub-agents:
- **Prompt Agent**: Generates optimized image prompts
- **Image Agent**: Creates images using Imagen API
- **Scoring Agent**: Evaluates images against policies  
- **Checker Agent**: Validates quality and iteration decisions

### Output Format Example

```
| Metric | Score | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Tool Trajectory Average Score | 1.0 | 1.0 | ✅ PASSED |
| Response Match Score | 0.2+ | 0.2 | ✅ PASSED |

Migration Success: ✅ uv dependency management functional
Environment Setup: ✅ GCP APIs and storage configured
```

### Test Scenario Evaluated

**Image Generation and Scoring Test** (`test.json`):
- **Input**: "A shepherd along with sheeps on a grassland"
- **Workflow**: Complete image generation, scoring, and policy evaluation cycle
- **Validation**: Proper tool sequence and multi-agent coordination

### Success Indicators
- ✅ **Tool Integration**: Correct sequence of policy retrieval, image generation, scoring, and checking
- ✅ **API Integration**: Successful connection to Vertex AI, Imagen, and Cloud Storage APIs
- ✅ **Workflow Orchestration**: Proper coordination between prompt, image, scoring, and checker sub-agents
- ✅ **Policy Compliance**: Implementation of policy-based image evaluation system
- ✅ **Storage Management**: Correct image storage and retrieval from Google Cloud Storage
