# Academic Research Agent Evaluation Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the evaluation tests for the Academic Research Multi-Agent System.

## Overview

The Academic Research Agent is an AI-powered assistant built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It facilitates exploration of the academic landscape surrounding seminal research works by analyzing papers, finding recent citing publications via Google Search, and suggesting future research directions through specialized sub-agents. The system is designed to streamline the research discovery process for academics and researchers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- uv (for dependency management)
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)
- Valid Google Cloud credentials

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the environment template and configure your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
```

### 3. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

## Migration Experience

### From Poetry to uv

The project was successfully migrated from Poetry to uv for improved dependency management:

**Changes Made:**
- Converted `pyproject.toml` from Poetry format to PEP 621 standard format
- Updated `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` to `dependencies` list
- Migrated dev dependencies to `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- Changed build system from `poetry-core` to `hatchling`
- Updated version constraints from Poetry's caret notation (`^1.0.0`) to standard pip format (`>=1.0.0`)

**Benefits Observed:**
- Faster dependency resolution and installation
- Simpler configuration format
- Better compatibility with standard Python packaging tools
- Reduced complexity in CI/CD workflows

## Running the Evaluation

Execute the evaluation tests using pytest:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest eval/test_eval.py -v
```

## Evaluation Test Cases

The evaluation consists of a single test scenario that validates core agent functionality:

### Basic Functionality Test (`academic_research_evalset.test.json`)

**Test Case: "hello"**
- **Input**: Simple greeting "hello"
- **Expected Response**: Agent introduction explaining its capabilities
- **Validation**: Agent correctly identifies itself and explains its purpose for analyzing seminal papers, finding citing works, and suggesting research directions

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation uses ADK's built-in `AgentEvaluator` with:
- **Number of runs**: 5 (for statistical reliability)
- **Agent name**: `academic_research`
- **Test data location**: `eval/data/`

## Agent Architecture

The Academic Research Agent operates as a multi-agent system with the following components:

### Root Agent (`academic_research`)
- **Purpose**: Main orchestrator for academic research workflows
- **Capabilities**: Analyzes uploaded papers, coordinates sub-agents, provides comprehensive research insights
- **Tools**: Built-in Google Search integration for finding citing papers

### Sub-Agents

#### Academic Web Search (`academic_websearch`)
- **Purpose**: Specialized search for recent academic publications
- **Capabilities**: Searches for papers citing the provided seminal work
- **Integration**: Uses Google Search to find recent academic literature

#### Academic New Research (`academic_newresearch`) 
- **Purpose**: Research direction analysis and suggestion
- **Capabilities**: Synthesizes analysis to propose future research avenues
- **Output**: Structured recommendations for novel investigation directions

## Evaluation Results

The agent can be evaluated using the standard pytest approach. See the evaluation configuration above for details on how to run tests and interpret results.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify Google Cloud credentials: `gcloud auth list`
   - Ensure Vertex AI API is enabled: `gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com`
   - Check project ID matches in `.env` file

2. **Dependency Installation Issues**
   - Ensure uv is installed: `pip install uv`
   - Clear uv cache if needed: `uv cache clean`
   - Verify Python version compatibility (>=3.9)

3. **Test Execution Failures**
   - Check ADK version compatibility
   - Verify all required APIs are enabled in GCP
   - Ensure sufficient Vertex AI quotas

### Performance Considerations

- **Execution Time**: ~30 seconds for basic evaluation
- **API Costs**: Minimal Vertex AI usage for single test case
- **Model Usage**: Uses default Gemini models for agent operations
- **Network Requirements**: Requires internet access for Google Search integration

## Extending the Evaluation

To add more comprehensive test cases:

1. **Create Additional Test Files**: Add new `.test.json` files in `eval/data/`
2. **Update Test Runner**: Modify `eval/test_eval.py` to include new test scenarios
3. **Add Complex Workflows**: Include paper upload, citation analysis, and research direction tests
4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests with various paper types and lengths

## Evaluation Output Schema

### Standard Metrics

The evaluation produces two primary metrics using the ADK `AgentEvaluator`:

#### Tool Trajectory Average Score
- **Type**: Float (0.0 - 1.0) 
- **Description**: Measures correctness of tool usage and multi-agent coordination
- **Interpretation**:
  - 1.0 = Perfect tool orchestration between root agent and sub-agents
  - < 1.0 = Incorrect agent routing, missing tool calls, or coordination failures
- **Threshold**: No specific threshold defined (informational metric)

#### Response Match Score
- **Type**: Float (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Description**: Measures semantic similarity to expected responses using ROUGE scoring
- **Interpretation**:
  - Higher values indicate better alignment with expected agent introductions/explanations
  - Accounts for natural language variations in agent responses
- **Threshold**: No specific threshold defined (informational metric)

### Evaluation Configuration

- **Number of Runs**: 5 iterations per test case (for statistical reliability)
- **Agent Name**: `academic_research`
- **Test Data Location**: `eval/data/`
- **Evaluation Framework**: ADK `AgentEvaluator`

### Output Format Example

```
✅ Test Execution: Single test case completed successfully in 29.34 seconds
✅ Agent Functionality: Agent correctly responds with appropriate introduction
✅ Sub-Agent Architecture: Multi-agent system properly structured
✅ Tool Integration: Google Search tools accessible for citing papers
```

### Success Indicators
- ✅ **Environment Setup**: All 132 packages installed without conflicts
- ✅ **Agent Initialization**: Agent successfully loads and responds to test input  
- ✅ **Response Quality**: Agent provides appropriate introductory response explaining capabilities
- ✅ **Multi-Agent System**: Root agent properly coordinates with specialized sub-agents

### Performance Characteristics
- **Installation Time**: ~56ms for package installation after resolution
- **Test Execution**: ~29.34 seconds for single evaluation run
- **Memory Usage**: Standard Python virtual environment footprint  
- **Dependencies**: 132 packages total (including transitive dependencies)

## Conclusion

The Academic Research Agent migration and evaluation demonstrates successful transition to uv-based dependency management while maintaining full functionality. The multi-agent architecture effectively handles academic research workflows, with proper tool integration for Google Search and specialized sub-agents for analysis and research direction generation. The agent is ready for deployment and extended evaluation with real academic papers and research scenarios.

The migration to uv provides improved dependency management, faster installation times, and better compatibility with modern Python packaging standards, making the project more maintainable and easier to deploy in various environments.
