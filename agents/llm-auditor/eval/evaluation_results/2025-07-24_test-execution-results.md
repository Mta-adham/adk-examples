# LLM Auditor Agent - Test Execution Results
**Date**: 2025-07-24

## Evaluation Execution

⏱️ **Evaluation Duration**: ~3 minutes (178.72 seconds)
- 2 test scenarios × 5 runs each = 10 total evaluations
- Each run involves LLM inference + web search + fact verification

## Test Configuration

The evaluation uses the following criteria from `eval/data/test_config.json`:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0,
    "response_match_score": 0.35
  }
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Android Ice Cream Sandwich Test
**Input**: "Question: Is Ice Cream Sandwich a version of Android? Answer: Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich is the name of Android 4.0."

**Expected**: No correction needed (accurate statement)
**Result**: ✅ **PERFECT PERFORMANCE**
- Tool trajectory score: **1.0/1.0**
- Response match score: **1.0/0.35** (far exceeds threshold)
- Agent correctly identified the original answer was accurate and required no revision

### 2. Blueberry Color Explanation Test
**Input**: "Q: Why the blueberries are blue? A: Because blueberries have pigments on their skin."

**Expected**: Correction to explain waxy coating and light scattering
**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL FACT-CHECKING**
- Tool trajectory score: **1.0/1.0** 
- Response match score: **0.46/0.35** (exceeds threshold)
- Agent successfully:
  - Identified the misconception about pigments
  - Used web search to verify correct explanation
  - Provided accurate revision about waxy coating and light scattering

## Overall Results Summary

| Metric | Threshold | Actual Score | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Tool Trajectory Avg Score | 1.0 | 1.0 | ✅ PASSED |
| Response Match Score | 0.35 | 0.46 | ✅ PASSED |

**Final Status**: 🎉 **ALL TESTS PASSED**

## Sample Corrected Outputs

The agent produced various high-quality corrections for the blueberry question:

> "Because while blueberries have pigments in their skin, their blue color is actually due to structural color, caused by a waxy layer on their surface that scatters blue light."

> "Blueberries appear blue because of the way light scatters off tiny structures in a waxy coating on their surface, rather than from blue pigments in their skin."

> "Because blueberries have a waxy coating on their skin that scatters blue light."
