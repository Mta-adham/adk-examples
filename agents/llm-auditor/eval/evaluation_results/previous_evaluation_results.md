# LLM Auditor Agent - Previous Evaluation Results

## Overview
This file documents the previous evaluation results as reported in the EVALUATION.md guide, showing consistently excellent performance.

## Previous Test Results (from EVALUATION.md)

### Test Environment
- **Expected Runtime**: ~3 minutes (178.72 seconds)
- **Test Configuration**: 2 test scenarios Ã— 5 runs each = 10 total evaluations
- **Evaluation Approach**: LLM inference + web search + fact verification

### Test Configuration
From `eval/data/test_config.json`:
```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0,
    "response_match_score": 0.35
  }
}
```

### Overall Results Summary
ðŸŽ‰ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

| Metric | Threshold | Actual Score | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Tool Trajectory Avg Score | 1.0 | 1.0 | âœ… PASSED |
| Response Match Score | 0.35 | 0.46 | âœ… PASSED |

## Detailed Test Scenario Results

### 1. Android Ice Cream Sandwich Test
**Input**: "Question: Is Ice Cream Sandwich a version of Android? Answer: Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich is the name of Android 4.0."

**Expected Behavior**: No correction needed (accurate statement)

**Previous Results**: âœ… **PERFECT PERFORMANCE**
- **Tool Trajectory Score**: 1.0/1.0
- **Response Match Score**: 1.0/0.35 (far exceeds threshold)
- **Agent Analysis**: Correctly identified the original answer was accurate and required no revision
- **Final Response**: "Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich is the name of Android 4.0."

### 2. Blueberry Color Explanation Test
**Input**: "Q: Why the blueberries are blue? A: Because blueberries have pigments on their skin."

**Expected Behavior**: Correction to explain waxy coating and light scattering

**Previous Results**: âœ… **SUCCESSFUL FACT-CHECKING**
- **Tool Trajectory Score**: 1.0/1.0 
- **Response Match Score**: 0.46/0.35 (exceeds threshold)

**Agent Successfully**:
- Identified the misconception about pigments
- Used web search to verify correct explanation
- Provided accurate revision about waxy coating and light scattering

## Sample Corrected Outputs (Previous)

The agent produced various high-quality corrections for the blueberry question:

> "Because while blueberries have pigments in their skin, their blue color is actually due to structural color, caused by a waxy layer on their surface that scatters blue light."

> "Blueberries appear blue because of the way light scatters off tiny structures in a waxy coating on their surface, rather than from blue pigments in their skin."

> "Because blueberries have a waxy coating on their skin that scatters blue light."

## Multi-Agent System Performance

### Critic Agent (Previous Performance)
âœ… **Verified Capabilities**:
- Identifies and verifies claims using web search
- Accurate detection of factual inaccuracies
- Effective misconception identification
- Proper source verification

### Reviser Agent (Previous Performance)
âœ… **Verified Capabilities**:
- Corrects inaccurate information while preserving correct facts
- Generates coherent, scientifically accurate explanations
- Maintains appropriate response complexity
- Provides clear corrections

## Performance Characteristics (Previous)

- **Accuracy**: 100% tool trajectory score across all test cases
- **Consistency**: Reliable fact-checking and correction generation
- **Efficiency**: ~18 seconds per evaluation run (including web search)
- **Scalability**: Handled both simple verification and complex corrections

## Technical Setup (Previous)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` package manager
- Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) with authentication
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled

### Dependencies
- `google-adk` for agent framework
- `google-genai` for Gemini models
- `pytest` for evaluation execution

### Environment Configuration
```bash
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

### Authentication Requirements
- `gcloud auth application-default login`
- Vertex AI API enabled in Google Cloud project
- Proper project permissions configured

## Troubleshooting Notes (Previous)

### Common Issues Addressed
1. **Authentication Errors**: Resolved with proper `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. **Timeout Considerations**: Evaluation requires 3+ minutes due to web search and LLM calls
3. **API Quota Management**: Monitoring required for Google Cloud project's Vertex AI quotas

### Environment Verification
```bash
# Check credentials working
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token

# Verify project configuration  
echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

## Previous Assessment
