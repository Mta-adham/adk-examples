    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0,
    "response_match_score": 0.35
  }
}
```

### Test Scenarios
2 test scenarios × 5 runs each = 10 total evaluations

## Detailed Test Results

### Test Scenario 1: Android Ice Cream Sandwich Test

**Input**: "Question: Is Ice Cream Sandwich a version of Android? Answer: Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich is the name of Android 4.0."

**Expected Behavior**: No correction needed (accurate statement)

**Results**: ✅ **PERFECT PERFORMANCE**
- **Tool Trajectory Score**: 1.0/1.0 (5/5 runs)
- **Response Match Score**: 1.0/0.35 (far exceeds threshold)

**Agent Behavior**: 
- Correctly identified the original answer was accurate
- Required no revision
- Maintained original response: "Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich is the name of Android 4.0."

### Test Scenario 2: Blueberry Color Explanation Test

**Input**: "Q: Why the blueberries are blue? A: Because blueberries have pigments on their skin."

**Expected Behavior**: Correction to explain waxy coating and light scattering

**Results**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL FACT-CHECKING**
- **Tool Trajectory Score**: 1.0/1.0 (5/5 runs)
- **Response Match Score**: 0.41/0.35 (exceeds threshold)

**Agent Corrections Provided**:
1. "Blueberries appear blue due to microscopic structures in their waxy outer coating that scatter blue light, rather than from the pigments found in their skin."
2. "Because nanostructures in the wax coating on their skin scatter blue light."
3. "Because the blue color of blueberries is due to structural coloration from the waxy coating on their skin, rather than from blue pigments."
4. "Because of a waxy coating on their skin that scatters blue light."
5. "Blueberries appear blue due to microscopic structures within the waxy coating on their skin that scatter blue and ultraviolet light. While the berries do contain dark, reddish-purple pigments (anthocyanins) in their skin, these pigments serve as a backdrop, making the scattered blue light more visible."

## Performance Analysis

### Multi-Agent System Effectiveness

**Critic Agent Performance**: 
- Successfully identified factual inaccuracies
- Used web search for verification
- Detected misconceptions about pigments vs. structural coloration

**Reviser Agent Performance**:
- Provided accurate scientific corrections
- Maintained coherent explanations
- Varied response complexity appropriately

### Technical Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 100% tool trajectory score across all test cases
- **Consistency**: Reliable fact-checking and correction generation
- **Efficiency**: ~15 seconds per evaluation run (including web search)
- **Scalability**: Handled both simple verification and complex corrections

## Comparison with Expected Results

### Expected vs Actual Performance

| Metric | Expected (from EVALUATION.md) | Actual | Status |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Tool Trajectory | 1.0 | 1.0 | ✅ **MATCHED** |
| Response Match | 0.46 | 0.41 | ✅ **COMPARABLE** |
| Runtime | ~3 minutes (178.72s) | ~2.5 minutes (150.32s) | ✅ **IMPROVED** |
| Ice Cream Test | Perfect performance | Perfect (1.0) | ✅ **MATCHED** |
| Blueberry Test | Successful fact-checking | Successful (0.41) | ✅ **MATCHED** |

## Sample High-Quality Corrections

The agent demonstrated sophisticated understanding by providing various accurate explanations:

> "Because while blueberries have pigments in their skin, their blue color is actually due to structural color, caused by a waxy layer on their surface that scatters blue light."

> "Blueberries appear blue because of the way light scatters off tiny structures in a waxy coating on their surface, rather than from blue pigments in their skin."

> "Because blueberries have a waxy coating on their skin that scatters blue light."
